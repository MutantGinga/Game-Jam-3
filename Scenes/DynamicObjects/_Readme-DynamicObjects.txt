A dynamic object can be placed on most types of object, this folder contains examples only.

Dynamic objects contain two components, an activator and a dynamic object.

The activator is something like a button, or pressure plate. Subclasses of these contain common methods so they will all function the same

A dynamic object is an object intended to move or activate in response to player interactions with an activator. 
These can be doors opening, portals activating or objects in the environment rotating. 
Subclasses are used to determine exact behaviour but all dynamic objects will contain some common methods.
